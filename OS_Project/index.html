    <h1>Welcome to Our Simple Web Server</h1>
    <p>This web page is hosted on a simple web server that tells us about multithreading, thread pool management, and synchronization concepts.</p>
    <h2>Key Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Multithreading:</strong>  Multithreading is a technique where multiple threads run within a single process, allowing for concurrent execution of tasks, enhancing performance and responsiveness.</li>
        <li><strong>Thread Pool:</strong> A thread pool is a managed collection of reusable threads, used to efficiently handle tasks in a queue, reducing the overhead of creating and destroying threads for each task.</li>
        <li><strong>Synchronization:</strong> Synchronization involves controlling access to shared resources among multiple threads to prevent race conditions and ensure data consistency and integrity.</li>
